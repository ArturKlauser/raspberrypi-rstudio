# Docker build file for RStudio Desktop Debian package for Raspberry Pi.
#
# This image can either be cross-built on an x86 host or built natively on a
# Raspberry Pi3 B+ (RP3) with 1 GB of RAM. The compilation, especially gwtc
# (java), needs a lot of memory so you need to add more swap on your RP3
# in order for the compile to succeed:
#   * In /etc/dphys-swapfile set CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024 (default is 100)
#   * Then run sudo service dphys-swapfile restart
#   * Once the build is done and you're happy with the result you can set
#     the swap space back to the default 100 MB with:
#     * In /etc/dphys-swapfile set CONF_SWAPSIZE=100
#     * sudo service dphys-swapfile restart
#
# Run the build like so:
#   docker build -t raspberrypi-rstudio-desktop-deb -f Dockerfile.desktop_deb .
# This will build the RStudio Desktop Debian package and leave it in the root
# directory.
